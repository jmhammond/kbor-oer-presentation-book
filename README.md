# Sample Book For KBOR OER Presentation

This is the sample book that I'm including for source examples in my presentation on PreText for the [KBOR OER Conference](https://www.kansasregents.org/academic_affairs/open-educational-resources/oer-conference)

## Building the Book:

### HTML 

To build the book as an interative webpage, run:

```bash
pretext build html
```

followed by 

``` bash
pretext view html
```

### PDF 

As a $\LaTeX$ pdf, use:

``` bash
pretext build pdf
```
You can then either open the PDF in your file browser, or use `pretext view pdf` to view the pdf in your browser.


### Additional build options

Explore the [PreText Author Guide documentation](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/processing-publisher-stringparam.html) to see more options (there's a lot you can do!)
